Description: Facilitates development and application of two-regression
    algorithms for research-grade wearable devices. It provides an easy
    way for users to access previously-developed algorithms, and also to
    develop their own. Initial motivation came from Hibbing PR, LaMunion SR,
    Kaplan AS, & Crouter SE (2018) <doi:10.1249/MSS.0000000000001532>.
    However, other algorithms are now supported. Please see the associated
    references in the package documentation for full details of the algorithms
    that are supported.
